## Current Progress Summary
The initial phase focused on establishing a solid foundation with:

1. Core Infrastructure:
   - Proper dependency management
   - Plugin lifecycle handling
   - Service initialization
   - Event subscription

2. Data Layer:
   - Price tracking
   - Volume analysis
   - Flip tracking
   - Time estimation

3. API Integration:
   - Real-time price updates
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Data caching

## Why This Approach?
1. Foundation First:
   - Started with core infrastructure to ensure stable base
   - Set up proper dependency injection for maintainable architecture
   - Implemented data models before UI to ensure solid domain model

2. Service Layer:
   - Built services with clear responsibilities
   - Added proper error handling and logging
   - Implemented caching for performance
   - Used concurrent data structures for thread safety

3. Time Estimation:
   - Implemented sophisticated volume tracking
   - Added confidence ratings
   - Created clear visual indicators
   - Built extensible category system

## Next Steps Rationale
Moving to UI development next because:
1. Core functionality is now testable
2. Data models are stable
3. Services are properly integrated
4. Can start showing value to users
5. Natural progression from backend to frontend

## Development Guidelines
1. Each phase should be completable within tool limits
2. Test features as they're implemented
3. Maintain clean architecture
4. Document as we go
5. Focus on user experience
6. Keep performance in mind

## Next Steps Detail
Phase 3 will focus on enhancing the UI with:
1. Interactive Charts
   - Price history visualization
   - Volume trends
   - Profit margins over time
   - Real-time updates

2. Context Menus
   - Quick buy/sell actions
   - Add to watchlist
   - Set price alerts
   - View detailed analysis

3. Search Improvements
   - Instant search
   - Advanced filters
   - Sorting options
   - Saved searches

Current Status: Ready for Phase 3 implementation
