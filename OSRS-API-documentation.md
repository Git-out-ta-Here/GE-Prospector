Application programming interface
Application programming interfaces, or APIs, are what developers, fansite operators, and bots use to retrieve information about the game and the wiki.

Most of the official RuneScape APIs do not output the correct CORS response headers that would allow use of the API in front end code on an external website, and thus meaning you should make your calls from a dedicated backend.[1] However, CORS issues can be circumvented from within a Chrome extension, so creating a Chrome extension is a possibility.

Main article: RuneScape:APIs
The RuneScape Wiki's API can be accessed here. The API Explorer special page can be used in addition to the documentation that MediaWiki has. Some features are limited to logged in users, administrators, and bureaucrats. The API Sandbox special page may be useful for users new to creating requests.

Bestiary API
Main article: RuneScape Bestiary ยง API
Grand Exchange Database API
The Grand Exchange Database, like the Bestiary API, is vast. It encompasses the Item Database which shows images of items not purchasable on the Grand Exchange itself and the catalogue information on tradeable items within the Grand Exchange. Queries in the API return JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

A note for OSRS - if you wish to access Old School Runescape's Grand Exchange, change "m=itemdb_rs" to "m=itemdb_oldschool" in the URL. Along with this, there is only 1 category. A proper call to get page 1 of all items that start with the letter 'c' for the OSRS API would look like: https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api/catalogue/items.json?category=1&alpha=c&page=1. Alpha is explained later in the wiki but it is the first letter of the item.
Configuration
info returns the runedate of when the Grand Exchange Database was last updated. The URL for the info query is https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/info.json.

Catalogue
category
category returns the number of items determined by the first letter. The URL for category queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/category.json?category=X where X is the category identification number as listed below for all possible types. For example, if we want to find all tradeable summoning familiars, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/category.json?category=9, which would result in

{"types":[],"alpha":[{"letter":"#","items":0},{"letter":"a","items":6},{"letter":"b","items":8},{"letter":"c","items":1},{"letter":"d","items":3},{"letter":"e","items":2},{"letter":"f","items":3},{"letter":"g","items":5},{"letter":"h","items":2},{"letter":"i","items":5},{"letter":"j","items":0},{"letter":"k","items":1},{"letter":"l","items":2},{"letter":"m","items":5},{"letter":"n","items":1},{"letter":"o","items":1},{"letter":"p","items":4},{"letter":"q","items":0},{"letter":"r","items":3},{"letter":"s","items":27},{"letter":"t","items":2},{"letter":"u","items":1},{"letter":"v","items":5},{"letter":"w","items":2},{"letter":"x","items":0},{"letter":"y","items":0},{"letter":"z","items":0}]}
Variable	Description	Data type
letter	The first letter of an item	string

items
items returns the first 12 items in the category given as shown below determined by the first letter. The URL for items queries are https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/items.json?category=X&alpha=Y&page=Z where X is the category identification number, Y is the starting letter (lower case) for the items and Z is the page number beginning at 1. Note that any items that start with a number must instead use %23 instead of #.

For example, if we want to find all tradeable summoning familiars that begin with "c", we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/items.json?category=9&alpha=c&page=1, which would result in

detail
detail returns current price and price trends information on tradeable items in the Grand Exchange, the category, item image and examine for the given item. The URL for detail queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/detail.json?item=X where X is the ItemID.

For example, if we want the information on steadfast boots, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/detail.json?item=21787, which would result in

{"item":{"icon":"https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/4856_obj_sprite.gif?id=21787","icon_large":"https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/4856_obj_big.gif?id=21787","id":21787,"type":"Miscellaneous","typeIcon":"https://www.runescape.com/img/categories/Miscellaneous","name":"Steadfast boots","description":"A pair of powerful-looking boots.","current":{"trend":"neutral","price":"17.0m"},"today":{"trend":"negative","price":"-897.2k"},"members":"true","day30":{"trend":"positive","change":"+27.0%"},"day90":{"trend":"positive","change":"+30.0%"},"day180":{"trend":"positive","change":"+8.0%"}}}

Images
The Grand Exchange Database can return item images with obj_big and obj_sprite. These images can sometimes be skewed since it includes items that might not necessarily be seen in game such as placeholder graphics for most cosmetic overrides from Solomon's General Store, use the mtx pet icon for various pets and the achievement banner in other cases. Many items from Treasure Hunter and Solomon's General Store can be seen before being released in-game by sometimes over a month ahead.

The URL for obj_big queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_big.gif?id=X where X is the ItemID.
The URL for obj_sprite queries is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_sprite.gif?id=X where X is the ItemID.
For example, if we want to see the image for Mod Daze's homework, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_big.gif?id=34775 for a detailed image or https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/obj_sprite.gif?id=34775 for the inventory icon. Unlike the images as seen in the game, the Grand Exchange Database images have a completely solid line surrounding items, which is different from ingame since there are breaks in images for borders.

Note that item images retrieved outside of the above place the most recent runedate before obj_big and obj_sprite. When the next system update occurs and info.json is updated, the link no longer operates for those that had a runedate in the link.

Graph
Graph shows the prices each day of a given item for the previous 180 days. The timecode is the number of milliseconds that has passed since 1 January 1970 and the price is the market value of the item for the given day. When no price information is available, then a value of zero is returned.

The URL for a graph is https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/graph/X.json where X is the ItemID. For example, if we want to know the last 180 days for steadfast boots, we'd go to https://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/graph/21787.json, where the previous three days, truncated for this article, would start out as

{"daily":{"1419897600000":15633853,"1419984000000":15475988,"1420070400000":15379017},"average":{"1419897600000":14708793,"1419984000000":14764787,"1420070400000":148288055}}
Variable	Description	Data type
daily	The item trade history over the past day (Grand Exchange value at the given timestamp)	[string...] (array of strings)
average	The item trade history for today (30 day moving average for the given timestamp)	[string...] (array of strings)
timecode	The first number showing the milliseconds since 1 January 1970	int
price	The second number showing the exact price and the average price	int
Bulk data
There's almost no scenario where you should be looping over every item if you need bulk GE data. If you need bulk GE data, see: RuneScape:Grand Exchange Market Watch/Usage and APIs#Bulk data API.

Solomon's General Store
Solomon's General Store's configuration API lists every past, current and upcoming items for the store. The URL for the configuration query is https://secure.runescape.com/m=mtxn_rs_shop/api/config?context%5B0%5D=0 where context[0]=0 allows players to view the media in the store. It is unsorted without help from secondary programs such as Google Chrome's developer tools to organise the list.

The version number in the API represents the last time the store was updated in milliseconds since 1 January 1970. There are several other API's that the store uses, however they require players to be logged into the RuneScape site.

Variable	Description	Data type
_type	The type of action that the store uses to view the object	string
version	The latest update in milliseconds since 1 January 1970	int
url	The list of links that the store uses	[string...] (array of strings)
phrasebook	Similar to MediaWiki's i18n pages	[string...] (array of strings)
media	The list of objects that appear in the store	[string...] (array of strings)
number	The id number that the store uses to show the object	int
imageUrl	The image link to display the icon or a gallery image	string
posterUrl	The image link to display a still image if MP4 is unsupported	string
videoUrl	The video link to display the MP4 of an item in the store	string
Website Data
Website data can provide information on a player's friends, their titles and what clan they are in.

playerDetails
playerDetails returns multiple players' titles, their clan, their name and if the clan they are in is recruiting. The URL for playerDetails is https://secure.runescape.com/m=website-data/playerDetails.ws?names=%5B%22X%22%5D&callback=jQuery000000000000000_0000000000&_=0 where X is the first players name and addition names can be provided by using a comma after X and surrounding them with quotes inside the brackets.

If the request is performed as a JSONP object on the RuneScape site, it can give the world the player is on if the online status is true.

$.ajax({
  url: "https://secure.runescape.com/m=website-data/playerDetails.ws?names=[%22Name%22]",
  dataType: "jsonp"
});
Note: The world and online status is only returned if the player is online on RuneScape and not Old School RuneScape. The player must also have their in-game online status set to "Everyone", and the player making the API call must be logged in on runescape.com (so that cookies are sent with the request).

Variable	Description	Data type
isSuffix	Determines if the player title is before the name	boolean
title	The player's title	string
clan	The clan's name	string
name	The player's name	string
recruiting	If the clan is recruiting players	boolean
world	The world or lobby a player is in	string
online	Determines if the player is online	boolean
playerFriendsDetails
playerFriendsDetails returns the logged-in player's own friends list. The URL for playerFriendsDetails is http://services.runescape.com/c=0/m=website-data/playerFriendsDetails.json?resultsPerPage=24&currentPage=1&callback=jQuery000000000000000_0000000000&_=0 where you must be logged in to view, the max results per request is 24 and the current page shows up to 24 players. It cannot be viewed as a web page. Depending on in-game settings, even when a player is online they might not appear to be online if Private is set to off.

Variable	Description	Data type
allFriends	Shows the total number of players a friend has	int
friends	The player's title	[string...] (array of strings)
number	Friends list sorted by most recently online	int

avatardetails (deprecated)
avatardetails returns a player's item information worn when taking a picture at the Photo booth for their Adventurer's Log. The URL for avatardetails is http://services.runescape.com/m=adventurers-log/avatardetails.json?details=X where X is the content of the appearance.dat for the player being viewed. The URL for appearance.dat is http://services.runescape.com/m=avatar-rs/X/appearance.dat where X is the player's name.

Can also bring up the avatar picture by using http://secure.runescape.com/m=avatar-rs/X/chat.png where X is the player's name. Use %20 for players names with spaces.

NPCs
Using appearance.dat, players can view the appearances of Jagex Moderators and other players easily. It allows anyone to see any monster, override, equipable items and the item information as an indirect item API. Strings are in the form of bits from 0 to 63 where the order is A-Z, a-z, 0-9, then - and *.

When an NPC is viewed, there is no information in avatardetails.json and the animation for the NPC. In a javascript console, players can view any NPC that is in the game with:

Module.avatar.module.ccall("SetAppearance", "void", ["string"], ["AP--AAA-----------------"]);
Where AAA is the NPC ID starting at 0 (Hans) and the next NPC starting at AAE as each NPC takes up four bits. The seventeen dashes following the ID are necessary to prevent from getting bad request messages in their console.

In a javascript console, when clicking on 'Idle' does not work, players can fix the animation of any NPC by using:

Module.avatar.SetAnimID(0)
Where 0 is the default structure of every NPC. It can sometimes be substituted for the animation IDs for that NPC if they are shown in their bestiary entry. Players might have to re-enter the SetAppearance string again to correct any issues.

Players
In a javascript console, players can view any other player with:

avatarViewer.avatarChange("X")
Where X is the other players' character name. This allows a player to view Jagex Moderators and other players that have privacy settings activated. Regardless of privacy settings, along with the full character image and chathead for the forums, the appearance.dat file is always viewable.

Each string can be changed to show equipable items that were not worn during the usage of the Photo Booth. The only way to use a custom string is in a javascript console by using:

Module.avatar.module.ccall("SetAppearance", "void", ["string"], ["AAAAAAABcgABHAEmAWEBIgEqA*SzIwAAAAAAABAQyAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiwAAAA"]);
Where the string of letters and numbers can be modified to show different hair styles, default clothing, and worn items.

The only item worn in this string is an aura, Daemonheim aura 4, noted by the string zIw. Not all strings are four letters and numbers as many are three letters and numbers. It changes the more items that are visible and whether or not they are recolourable can add complexity to the string.

Runemetrics
Since Runemetrics is an Angular application, it uses public endpoints to grab its data from the server. This opens up the possibility to directly pull data from said endpoints in your own application.

Since these endpoints are not official API URL's, they don't seem to have the strict request throttling that the regular API has.

Profile
/profile returns a player's Runemetrics profile data. This includes name, total experience, skill levels, combat experience and activity. The URL is https://apps.runescape.com/runemetrics/profile/profile?user=X&activities=20 where X is the player's name.

This data includes the amount of experience obtained in the last 12 months, the average exp for the selected skill, the total amount of exp gained within the last 12 months and the total exp in the selected skill. The URL is https://apps.runescape.com/runemetrics/xp-monthly?searchName=X&skillid=Y where X is the player's name and Y is the id of the skill.

The response contains the object monthlyXpGain which will be explained below and a string ("true"/"false") for loggedIn which is only present when not signed in to Runemetrics (this does not indicate whether a player is online or not).

GET /runelite-{version}/item/{itemId}
```
Returns detailed item information.

#### Item Icons
```
GET /cache/item/icon/{itemId}
```

### 3. Official OSRS GE API
Base URL: `https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api`

#### Item Details
```
GET /catalogue/detail.json?item={itemId}
```
Returns official GE data.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Rate Limiting
- Wiki API: 300 requests per minute
- RuneLite API: No strict limit, use responsibly
- OSRS API: 100 requests per minute

### Caching Requirements
1. Price Data
   - Latest prices: 1 minute
   - Averages: 5 minutes
   - Historical data: 1 hour

2. Item Data
   - Item information: 24 hours
   - Icons: 7 days
   - Market trends: 15 minutes

### Error Handling

#### HTTP Status Codes
- 200: Success
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 503: Service unavailable
- 504: Gateway timeout

#### Recovery Strategies
1. Rate Limiting
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Queue requests
   - Use bulk endpoints where possible

2. Service Unavailable
   - Fallback to cached data
   - Retry with backoff
   - Alert user if persistent

### Data Processing

#### Price Calculations
1. Profit Margins
```java
margin = sellPrice - buyPrice - (sellPrice * 0.01)
```

2. Volume Metrics
```java
volumeScore = (hourlyVolume * priceStability) / competitionFactor
```

3. Time Estimates
```java
estimatedMinutes = baseTime * volumeFactor * timeOfDayFactor
```

### Best Practices

1. API Calls
   - Use bulk endpoints when possible
   - Implement proper caching
   - Handle rate limits gracefully
   - Log all API errors

2. Data Management
   - Validate responses
   - Handle missing data
   - Implement fallbacks
   - Monitor API health

3. Updates
   - Poll latest prices every minute
   - Update averages every 5 minutes
   - Refresh item data daily
   - Clean cache weekly

## Testing

### API Tests
1. Connection Tests
   - Endpoint availability
   - Response times
   - Rate limit handling
   - Error responses

2. Data Tests
   - Response validation
   - Data consistency
   - Cache effectiveness
   - Update frequency

### Mock Data
- Sample responses in `src/test/resources/api-responses/`
- Test scenarios in `src/test/resources/test-cases/`
- Rate limit simulations
- Error condition mocks

## Security

### API Authentication
- Include user agent
- Respect rate limits
- Handle keys securely
- Monitor usage

### Data Protection
- Validate responses
- Sanitize data
- Encrypt sensitive info
- Secure storage

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
- API availability
- Response times
- Error rates
- Cache hits/misses

### Alerts
